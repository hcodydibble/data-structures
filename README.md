# Python Data Structures

This repo is here to hold all the data structures I write, or at least attempt to write, in my never-ending
pursuit of knowledge in the world of development. Previous works were done with [Adrienne](http://github.com/adriennekarnoski)
and are thus pushed up on her [data-structures repo](http://github.com/adriennekarnoski/data-structures) and mine
will be starting with the Binary Search Tree.

**Installation**:

In case you feel like pulling this down and making the code better, writing more tests to attempt to disprove my
knowledge of these data structures or you just want to mess around in it there are just a few steps you need to follow.

- `$ git clone http://github.com/hcodydibble/data-structures.git`
- `$ cd data-structures/`
- `$ pip install -e .` (The -e is so any changes you make will immediately affect the package without needing to reinstall)

**Tests**:

To run the tests (and to see my amazing coverage and all those precious precious dots) is just as simple as the installation
(and one of these steps can be done above but writing things twice is fun).

- `$ pip install -e .[test]`
- `$ tox`
